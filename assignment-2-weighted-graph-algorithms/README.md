# Assignment 2
## Weighted Graph Algorithms
### Overview
You task is to code a small collection of graph algorithms:

* Dijkstra's algorithm
* Connectivity testing
* Connected component search
* Articulation point search

These will use the weighted graph from assignment 1 (or rather, a modified, definitely working version of it).

---

### The Code
You are provided with a number of C++ files, the one you will be assessed on is ```graph_algorithms.cpp```. The four methods present in the skeleton are the entry point for the tests. To support this there is a ```weighted_graph.hpp``` file, which includes a fully working implementation of a weighted graph. Note that it is somewhat different from the assignment 1 specification, so make sure you familiarise yourself with it. In addition there is a ```simple_weighted_graph_algorithms.cpp``` file which includes an implementation of breadth first and depth first traversals. This may be a useful model of how to work with ```graph_algorithms.cpp```. You are also provided with a ```main.cpp``` to do any testing you like. The run button will compile and execute main.cpp, the submit button will run ```graph_algorithms.cpp``` against the tests.

You may modify any of these files as you see fit, as long as the tests still execute, apart from adding additional libraries, though you have an extended collection of libraries compared to assignment 1.

As with the first assignment, you should be able to complete the assignment within the ```graph_algorithms.cpp``` file (though you are not restricted to this), but you will likely need to add extra functions, perhaps extra classes, so on and so forth.

In a folder you can also view the testing code. This is not the copy that is executed, it's just there for your edification. If any bugs or mistakes in the tests are discovered, the actual tests may be altered, so the code here should only be taken as a guide (hopefully a good guide, but nonetheless).

### The Algorithms
As mentioned in the overview, you are to implement four graph based algorithms. In rough order of difficulty, they are:

1. Connectivity testing
1. Finding all connected components
1. Dijkstra's algorithm
1. Finding all articulation points

As these are described in the lectures, I will not add additional clutter here about their function or details (but you can of course as questions).

Functionality will be marked exclusively by the tests, and constitutes 70% of the total mark (note that the marks for the tests add up to 70 - so they give you the percentage you will get as well).

Design will be marked in your Week 12 tutorial by your tutor and constitutes 20% of the total mark. It does not depend on the functionality of your code. You may be asked questions by your tutor to help them test your understanding of your code. It will be marked qualitatively against the following rubric:

**Pass**: The code shows basic understanding of how to employ data
structures to achieve a goal. The design should avoid unnecessary
data structures and should make reasonable use of
iteration and recursion when appropriate.

**Credit**: The design shows a solid understanding of data structures and
demonstrate effective use of control structures to achieve the
programâ€™s goals.

**Distinction**: The design shows a high degree of understanding of how to
use data structures to achieve a goal efficiently, and demonstrate
some evidence that the design does not use unnecessary
resources. The design should be clean and efficient.

**High Distinction**: The design demonstrates a high degree of understanding of data structures and how to efficiently employ them to build
algorithms that not only meet technical goals, but support
maintenance and future development.

Style will also be mark in your Week 12 tutorial by your tutor and constitutes 10% of the total mark. It will be marked qualitatively against the following rubric:

**Pass**: The code mostly uses some formatting standard and is somewhat
readable.

**Credit**: The code adheres well to a formatting standard and variables
are well named.

**Distinction**: At least as well formatted as for Credit standards, along with
sufficient inline commenting to explain the code.

**High Distinction**: Excellent formatting and variable naming. Excellent, judiciously employed comments that explain the code without just repeating the code.

### Marking Schedule

All being well, assuming you submit before the deadline and attend your Week 12 tutorial (in the class you are actually enrolled in - exceptions will only be made for cases where attendance at your enrolled tutorial is impossible), we aim to return the marks for the assignment within a week of the tutorial. However, we reserve the right to delay this schedule should technical problems arise.

---

### Submission
You will submit your work with the "submit" button on Ed. No other submissions will be accepted. You are welcome to develop your code elsewhere, if that suits your workflow, but remember it must compile and run on Ed. We are using the clang++ compiler set to C++11 standard for this assessment, so avoid using C++14 (or later) only features. However code that compiles with g++ should also work with clang++ (unless you're doing something weird - so check first!).

### Due Date
The assignment is due before midnight on the Monday of Week 12, which should be the 4th of June.

### Plagiarism Checking
All code will be checked for student misconduct and plagiarism using specialised code similarity detection software.
